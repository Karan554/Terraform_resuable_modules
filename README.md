# Terraform_resuable_modules

Didn't added the AWS provider terraform file which I created separately
for ec2 and vpc modules: I have added all the resources of ec2 in ec2 module and all the vpc resources in vpc module.
If sepaarate modules are required I can also create the separate modules for them as well
